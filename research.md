This is an infant gym with sensors which assesses infants in their natural play environment. PANDA gym provides quantifiable metrics that can be used in place of current subjective analysis for early diagnosis of motor delays. My work details the pressure sensitive mat that gathers center of pressure (CoP) information of infant movement while they play in the gym in a supine position.

Completed Objectives:
* Perform clinical trials at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)
* Identify relations of COP movement and Approximate Entropy to infant development
* Design and manufacture a robust casing and assembly for mat electronics
* Evaluate and analyze data using Matlab
* Create visualizations to represent data, a [poster](https://github.com/susan-z/susan-z.github.io/blob/master/PANDAGym_LSAMP_SusanZhao.pdf) and [presentation](https://github.com/susan-z/susan-z.github.io/blob/master/projects/PANDA%20Gym_v3novids.pptx) on discoveries

## BAXTER
BAXTER is a robot created by Rethink Robotics to be a safe, flexible, affordable alternative to fixed automation. In the field of mobile therapy assistants, Baxter is a perfect candidate to act as a therapist to stroke survivors. The study involving the Baxter robot involved three stages:  learning, demonstration, and teaching.  In the learning phase, Baxter was trained how to mimic a real-life therapist;  this was done by using Microsoft Kinect, which maps the kinematic configuration of the human to Baxter.  After the robot demonstrates what it has learned from the therapist, the robot ostensibly would be capable of giving the desired therapy to the patient. 

The manipulators on the Baxter robot (see below) were not appropriate for assisting human movements. I was tasked with designing and producing a simple set of "hands" to allow Baxter to safely and effectively interact with a human patient.

## DNA functionalization of Colloidal Nano and Microparticles
This was my first independent research project. This experience allowed me to comprehend the dedication and effort required to conduct research and understand a completely new concept to a deeper level.

Skills acquired:
* Researched a rising topic in its field: analyzed relevant information and wrote [documentation](https://github.com/susan-z/susan-z.github.io/blob/master/projects/Colloids.pdf)
* Created protocols for the DNA functionalization of both [nanoparticles](https://github.com/susan-z/susan-z.github.io/blob/master/projects/Protocol_nanoparticle.pdf) and [microparticles](https://github.com/susan-z/susan-z.github.io/blob/master/projects/Protocol_microparticle.pdf)

</p>
Skills acquired:
* Genotyping: preparation of DNA, running PCR reactions and gel electrophoresis
* Maintained a lab journal documenting all genotypes and target genes
