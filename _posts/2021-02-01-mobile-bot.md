## Autonomous pick-and-place
We developed a smart controller for following trajectories and a full simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system implemented on an MBot-Mini. The integration of low level control, sensor and motion models, and high-level algorithms results in a robot capable of providing a stable estimate of its pose and map. Navigation performance is evaluated with respect to events, consisting of driving a path circuit at normal and high speeds, autonomous exploration and generation of a map, and localizing from an unknown starting position.
