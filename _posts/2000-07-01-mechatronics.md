## Senior Design Project
This capstone design project was intended for teams to design and test complex mechanical systems that address a societal or consumer need. The following was my Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics Senior Design project, FlipSide.

### FlipSide: Pixelated Design Board

Render | Final Prototype

FlipSide is an electromechanical design board tailored to those who desire an old-school, non-digital sign while maintaining the same level of web-based control and automation. The sign consists of a uniform array of pixels that can be individually altered. A carriage of five solenoids moves along a cartesian system, actuating relevant pixels to produce the desired words and message. Team FlipSide had a corporate sponsor, Oat Foundry, who specialize in split-flap displays. To get a little peek of where FlipSide is now, check out the video below.

Team FlipSide was comprised of Edward Devlin, Shirley Dong, Michael Gigante, Charles Hussey, Madeline McGovern, and Susan Zhao and advised by Professor Mark Yim.

The objective was to design and build an RC robot to compete in a MOBA-inspired tournament. My team of four developed a small, lightweight robot with differential drive, capable of weaving through the constructed maze-like arena.<br>
<br>
Additional characteristics include: Communication through UDP connected controllers, frequency-sensing light detection, servo-controlled attack arms, LED visual cues for health and attack <br>
<br>
Left: Robot traversing the maze to reach the Nexus, lowering enemy health

The focus of this project was to create a two degree of freedom input and output device. The input device utilized hall sensors for position sensing, paired with continuous feedback and PID control to position the motors in the output device into the correct position. This allows for remote manipulation with devices of different scales.
