During my time at Verb, I have had significant experience with multiple stages of a product development cycle. This spans projects at the production level to developing tests for medical device validation and verification. My position as a systems integration engineer exposed me to complex subsystems where I greatly improved on my troubleshooting, debugging and root-cause analysis skills. As much of the product information is not public, the summaries of my projects will honor that confidentiality.

# Selected Projects
## Robotic Sugical Arm Control Characterization
The purpose was to characterize the system performance against a system requirement. I worked with cross-functional teams to develop test protocols and gain alignment on metrics. By designing and prototyping fixtures, writing Python and Matlab test scripts, as well as purchasing qualified measurement devices, I produced repeatable, well-documented characterization tests. This in turn generated the quantitative data used to compare against qualitative user data and analytical approaches. Through this entire process, I maintained clear communication with the team, giving weekly updates and presenting data. This also became the basis of a reliability test, where the knowledge transfer was swift and easy due to my organization and protocols.


## Calibration of Motor Torque Constant
I was given ownership of this project, to take it from early stages of prototyping and testing to full maturity at the manufacturing level. I led design review meetings, then followed up with performing tasks in parallel to get all the hardware and software components designed, ordered, reviewed and cleared for integration in the production line. Not only did the calibration script and setup produce the calculated torque constant of the motor in its built-up configuration, but I optimized for time without losing accuracy and precision by assessing the number of testpoints and calculating the residuals. This test was successfully transferred to manufacturing, again cleanly due to my attention to detail with the organization and quality of test scripts and protocols.
