From April 2020 to August 2022, I was a Software Engineer for the New Product Introduction team at Intuitive Surgical. All of my work was applied towards next-generation products, therefore the following project summaries will honor that confidentiality.

# Automated Calibration and Testing
A significant responsibility was to implement, optimize, and evaluate calibration and functional tests for subassemblies and integrated systems. It was critical to determine pass/fail criteria, perform data analysis on outcomes, and fully understand safety and clinical requirements. Doing such work required strong communication and alignment with multiple stakeholders such as manufacturing, field service, and the software architecture teams. Several highlights of my contributions include:
* Lead multiple projects, including senior-engineer level top assembly projects. Established as point of contact for upgrades and calibrations
* Debugged and applied changes via MATLAB and Python to resolve issues and meet all quarterly and yearly company goals in terms of production units
* Released projects to the manufacturing line and developed all necessary documents
* Understanding of validation and quality protocols (DQ/IQ/OQ/PQ)

### Skills and Learnings: 
* MATLAB, Python
* RESTful API, Swagger
* Calibrating systems: encoder calibration, gravity compensation, primary and secondary sensor alignment, time-of-flight sensor offsets, etc.
* Characterizing systems: holding torque, friction profiles, motor constants, etc.
* BLDC, brushed motors, harmonic drives

# Web based Test Platform
This project concerned a web-based application of the diagnostic test platform used in manufacturing. I made initial contributions, then demonstracted a proof of concept, and finally developed applicable projects on subassemblies which were deployed on the manufacturing line. Through this process, I led weekly team sync meetings, and consulted stakeholders for prioritization of features. I gave several presentations and demos, namely to the VP of Engineering and the overall company on an exhibition day. 

### Skills and Learnings: 
* Flask, nginx
* Project Management
* Web Applications

### Additional Experience
* Embedded system, mechanical design, and software integration
* Exposure to FPGAs, low level memory support
* Mentorship of summer intern
* Implementation of long term solutions following short-term workarounds to account for deadlines
* Jenkins: unit tests, continuous integration
* JIRA, Bitbucket
