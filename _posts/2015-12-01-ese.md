## Electrical Circuits and Systems
This course (ESE215) began with basic electric circuit analysis techniques of linear circuits, then delved into 1st order and 2nd order circuits in both the time and frequency domains, frequency behavior of circuits and the use of transfer functions. Designing, building and experimenting with electrical and electronic circuits were performed in a hands-on weekly lab. 

### Final Pair Project
The final project was an audio docking station. There are three major components: a bass and treble filter, an amplifier, and a power supply. 
* Power supply: constructed by converting an AC input to a +12 and -12DC output
* Treble and bass filter: takes an audio signal as the input, and separates it into “bass” or low frequency, and “treble” or high frequency signals
* Amplifier: intensifies the signal enough to power the signal through the speakers provided

This project required the initial design of the filter, amplifier, and power supply, a working simulation of each component and the components integrated, and finally testing and reiteration of the components adjusted for differences from the simulation.

## Silicon Garage
This was a hands-on lab course about open source hardware and software platforms.  It explored Aruino and Raspberry Pi platforms as well as using the programming language, Processing, to interface the microcontrollers to sensors. Mini-projects that preceded the final pair project concerned many electrical parts: LEDs, pushbuttons, photocells, transistors (MOSFET), bluetooth and wifi modules, and OpAmps for filtering signals. 

### Final Pair Project

For the final project, we decided to create a robotic arm with a gripper. There are four degrees of freedom, with one servo moter pivoting the base, another activating the gripper, and two other motors controlling the links. LED lights decorate the sides and have three modes: on, off, and blinking. The servo motors were controlled by an Arduino.
