# About
<img src="{{ page.image }}" style="width:200px;" alt="{{ page.title }}">

<p> Hello! I am currently pursuing a Robotics Master's degree at the University of Michigan. I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania where I majored in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science, then spent a few years in California working in industry, mainly in the robotic-assisted surgery field. I have always been drawn to multidisciplinary projects, especially those in the fields of robotics and mechatronics. My decision to return to school is centered upon building a solid foundation in software and focusing on applying learnings to robotics projects. Please have a look around my website, and feel free to contact me by email: susanmz(at)umich(dot)edu or susanmzhao(at)gmail(dot)com.</p>
