# About
![Profile Image]({{page.image}})

<p> Hello! I am a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, where I majored in mechanical engineering alongside a minor in computer science. My hometown is Edison, NJ - but I've moved to California to pursue a career in robotics. I've grown up with a love for volleyball, doodling, pilates and horror movies.  I've always been drawn to multidisciplinary projects, especially those in the fields of robotics and mechatronics. It has always been important for me to strongly and deeply believe in a company's drive and vision. Please have a look around my website, and feel free to contact me by email: susanmzhao(at)gmail(dot)com.</p>
