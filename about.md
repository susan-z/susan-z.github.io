# About

<p style="float: right; width: 65%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> Hello! I am a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, where I majored in mechanical engineering alongside a minor in computer science. My hometown is Edison, NJ - but I've moved to California to pursue a career in robotics. I've grown up with a love for volleyball, doodling, pilates and horror movies. </p>

<p style="float: right; width: 65%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> I've always been drawn to multidisciplinary projects, especially those in the fields of robotics and mechatronics. It has always been important for me to strongly and deeply believe in a company's drive and vision. Please have a look around my website, and feel free to contact me via phone: 848-219-0646, or by email: susanmzhao@gmail.com.</p>
