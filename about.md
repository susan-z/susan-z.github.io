# About
<img src="{{ page.image }}" style="width:200px;" alt="{{ page.title }}">

<p> Hello! I am currently pursuing a Robotics Master's degree at the University of Michigan. I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania where I majored in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science, then spent a few years in California working in industry, mainly in the robotic-assisted surgery field. I've always been drawn to multidisciplinary projects, especially those in the fields of robotics and mechatronics. It has always been important for me to strongly and deeply believe in a company's drive and vision. My decision to return to school is centered upon building a solid foundation in software and focusing on applying learnings to robotics projects. Please have a look around my website, and feel free to contact me by email: susanmzhao(at)gmail(dot)com.</p>
